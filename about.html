        <p class="about__p">
          This application is designed to help you track your progress if you’re
          interested in living with the philosophy called “The Nine Delights”.
          It means trying to experience at least three of the nine delights of
          the life each day.
        </p>
        <h2 class="about__heading-h2">The delights are:</h2>
        <p class="about__p">
          <span>Walking around</span> - experiencing the pleasure of a good
          stroll <br />
          <span>Fellowship</span> - spending time with friends <br />
          <span>Deliciousness</span> - eating something tasty <br />
          <span>Transcendence</span> - the feeling of achieving the new level in
          something, doing something to the most and feeling good about it
          <br />
          <span>Goofing</span> - having a good laugh <br />
          <span>Amelioration</span> - working on betterment of something, a
          skill or deed
          <br />
          <span>Coitus</span> - acts of sexual nature that bring pleasure <br />
          <span>Enthralment</span> - the feeling of immense concentration on
          something, being incredibly engaged <br />
          <span>Wildcard</span> - anything you consider a delight that you feel
          doesn’t fit one of the above
        </p>
        <p class="about__p">
          For the benefit of you, the user, I created this application to help
          self-discovery. <br />
          On the main page you can tick off the delights you had this day and
          save them to the database. <br />
          Then, on the Statistics page you could see the progression of the
          delights in your life. <br />
          Enjoy!
